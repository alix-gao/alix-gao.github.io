## background
this week our project team needed a workstation for development. i installed ubuntu 24.04 on this workstation.

to access the network, we purchased a TP-LINK AX900 WiFi dongle.

unfortunately, the official driver does not work. so i made some modifications to get it functioning properly.

if you encounter the same problem, you can download the new driver below.
