## what are xen & threadx?
[xen](https://xenproject.org) is a type-I hypervisor, [threadx](https://threadx.io) is a RTOS.
## why we need virtualization?
in many industries, it is necessary to be able to run different operating systems (or even no operating system at all) to meet various business requirements. multiple OS could be run without hypervisor. however, the system mostly restart if one core crashed. the embedded field has extremely high requirements for stability, and virtualization can enhance stability.

others include, resource efficiency, isolation and security, scalability and flexibility, and so on.
## why xen & threadx?
QNX is primarily used in the automotive sector and is a closed-source operating system.
